# feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

Yes, it's a blatant rip-off of [holman/feedback](https://github.com/holman/feedback).

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/patrickbarrn/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered. If you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/patrickbarrn/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. I'm [@patbarron1](https://twitter.com/patbarron1) on
Twitter.
